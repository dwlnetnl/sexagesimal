# sexagesimal

This package provides sexagesimal formatting for the four types defined in the
external package github.com/soniakeys/unit.  Those types are Angle, HourAngle,
RA, and Time.

Code in this package was written to support the external package
github.com/soniakeys/meeus, a collection of astronomy routines.  Actually
though, this package is used only for nicely readable examples in the meeus
package.  It is thus only a test dependency.  Neither this package nor
meeus depend on each other.  Both depend on unit.

This package is public domain.
